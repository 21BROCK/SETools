# SEAToolsMaya
A .SEA format import / export plugin for maya

## Installation:
Download the latset [seanim.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dtzxporter/SEAnimMaya/master/seanim.py) and [SEAToolsPlugin.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dtzxporter/SEAnimMaya/master/SEAToolsPlugin.py) from the repo and save them in `Documents\maya\<mayaversion\scripts`

If you have a usersetup.mel edit it and put `python("import SEAToolsPlugin");` on it's own line, otherwise create this file and add the line to it. Close and reopen maya to see the new SEA Tools menu.
